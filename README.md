![A stylised illustration of a mother holding her smiling infant, rendered in warm orange tones. The image symbolises the newborn’s cry and caregiver recognition as the foundational exchange of epistemic life, where comfort and care scaffold resilience and autonomy.](https://github.com/Peter-Kahl/KMED-I-infant-simulation-epistemic-psychology/blob/main/mum_baby.jpg?raw=true)

This repository contains the official Python reference implementations of the **Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance (KMED)**.

KMED is a mathematical and computational framework for modelling epistemic clientelism, dissonance, and resilience in intimate and institutional contexts.
